## Mission

Reference checklist of things to avoid gatekeeping in posts, articles, videos, talks, presentations, podcasts, and in any other content.

It is *your job* to make sure that **every** piece of content you put out is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to all. This checklist is here to make your life easier. No longer will you need to remeber every single thing you need to do in order to stop accidental gatekeeping in your content.
