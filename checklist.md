# Welcome to OpenGates
A reference checklist of things to help you avoid gatekeeping in you posts, articles, videos, talks, presentations, podcasts, sites, and in any other content.

It is _your job_ to make sure that **every** piece of content you put out is inclusive, welcoming, and accessible to all. This checklist is here to make your life easier. No longer will you need to remember every single thing you need to do in order to stop accidental gatekeeping when creating and building. Do know that depending on what you are building, some of the list items may not apply.
