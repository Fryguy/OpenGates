Hi there! Welcome to the repo for [OpenGates](https://vickilanger.github.io/AntiGatekeep/).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request.

### How do I do that?

First time? I suggest starting with adding items to `checklist.md`. Check out [issue #1 to add nouns](https://github.com/VickiLanger/OpenGates/issues/1) for more details.

If you need more of a step-by-step, skim through [this walkthrough](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) or [this article about making your first contribution](https://dev.to/vickilanger/open-up-to-open-source-contributing-5hla).

### Safety
This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.

Again, safety comes first, please read through the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/VickiLanger/OpenGates/blob/production/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well.
